## What is this?

Hast thou ever readeth a webpage and wonder'd:

> *"What if this article were written by the Bard himself?"*

**Wonder no more.**

3. Browse any website and enjoy thy newfound Shakespearean enlightenment.

> NOTE:
> - for use on Google Chrome:
> on chrome (violent monkey is not working for some reason, so I used tampermonkey to check), you need to turn on developer mode from "chrome://extensions" and enable user script in the extension setting (opened when you click on the tamper monkey extension) for it to > work. these are just google chromes checks, not extension issues
> - for use in Microsoft Edge:
> directly use it from violent monkey, no issues

## What does it do?

The script walks through text nodes on any web page and replaces:

- Common words (`you` → `thou`, `are` → `art`)
- Modern phrases (`no way` → `fie! it cannot be!`)


Example transformations:

> "I'm so happy you're here!"  
> becomes  
> "My heart singeth with joy thou art hither!"
