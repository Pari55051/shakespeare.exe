## What does it do?

The script walks through text nodes on any web page and replaces:

- Common words (`you` → `thou`, `are` → `art`)
- Modern phrases (`no way` → `fie! it cannot be!`)
- Dynamic content too! (It watches for DOM changes and updates on-the-fly)

Example transformations:

> "I'm so happy you're here!"  
> becomes  
> "My heart singeth with joy thou art hither!"
